FlatUI
======

A refreshing, light colorscheme compatible with terminal Vim, focusing on
greens and blues, sprinkled with oranges and reds. 

I wanted a cool, light, xterm compatible colorscheme. Instead of trying to come
up with my own colors, I decided to piggy-back on the awesome work done on
[flatuicolors.com](http://flatuicolors.com).

This is a work in progress. Constantly changing. Use a plugin manager to keep up.

**Note**: All screenshots taken using terminal Vim, and using the
[vim-airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline) theme "luna".

TODO:
----

1. Improve syntax colors (this will never over)
2. Set "dark" version (dark could be a warmer version. i.e. using mainly
orange and red)
3. Create vim-airline theme
4. Higher contrast version (maybe)
